# Simplifications of the Rules

- during training there are no draws (stalemate is a loss for the one that cannot move and everything else is ignored and after a number of moves exceeds a specified threshold the player with more material wins)

- en passant (completely)

- castling (also not allowed)

- pawn at the end of the board gets automatically traded for a QUEEN (sometimes u would like another piece)
